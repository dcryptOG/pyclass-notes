# BOOLEANS are TRUE or FALSE operators
#! important for control flow & logic


# Booleans

# Python comes with Booleans (with predefined True and False displays that are basically just the integers 1 and 0).


# # Set object to be a boolean
a = True

print(a)

# True

# We can also use comparison operators to create booleans. We will go over all the comparison operators later on in the course.

# # Output is boolean
1 > 2

# False

#  It also has a placeholder object called None. Let's walk through a few quick examples of Booleans (we will dive deeper into them later in this course).

#! # None placeholder
b = None

print(b)

# None
