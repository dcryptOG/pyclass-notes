# Python program to shuffle a deck of card using the module random and draw 5 cards

            'Spade', 'Heart', 'Diamond', 'Club']))

# shuffle the cards

# Output

# You got:
# 5 of Heart
# 1 of Heart
# 8 of Spade
# 12 of Spade
# 4 of Spade

# Note: Run the program again to shuffle the cards.

# In program, we used the product() function in itertools module to create a deck of cards. This function performs the Cartesian product of the two sequence.

# The two sequence are, numbers from 1 to 13 and the four suits. So, altogether we have 13 * 4 = 52 items in the deck with each card as a tuple. For e.g. deck[0] = (1, 'Spade').

# Our deck is ordered, so we shuffle it using the function shuffle() in random module.

# Finally, we draw the first five cards and display it to the user. We will get different output each time you run this program as shown in our two outputs.

# Here we have used the standard modules itertools and random that comes with Python.
